      "description": "gentle uses transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)—a safe, low-level electrical current clinically shown to regulate neural activity linked to mood and motivation. By delivering a precise, gentle signal to the prefrontal cortex, the headband helps rebalance the brain circuits often disrupted by depression, fatigue, or stress. Unlike medications that alter chemistry throughout the body, gentle targets the brain directly, promoting natural neuroplasticity and emotional stability without side effects.\n\nBuilt for daily use, the headband syncs with the gentle app to guide each session, track progress, and personalize settings. It’s quiet, portable, and designed for people seeking a science-based, medication-free way to feel more energized, focused, and emotionally balanced.",
